Use quantum circuit as function approximator and construct the differential equation via parameter-shift rule.</br>
Finally, compute the mean square error loss and use Adam to optimize the circuit.</br></br>
Check learning_process.gif to know how the quantum circuit learn to approximate the solution.</br>
You can get a better convergence if you fine-tune the hyperparameters.</br></br>
